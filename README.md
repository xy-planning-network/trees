# Vue the Trees

## What's Trees
Trees is our attempt at unifying the frontend code we've written to power a small handful of web applications. We prefer the slower method of walking the [trails](https://github.com/xy-planning-network/trails), smelling the trees, and staying closer to the dirt than something speedier on the road. This bad boy is just getting of the ground and will be in v0 for the foreseeable future.

## What needs to be done?
- [x] Skeleton for NPM Component Library
- [x] Button component
- [x] Form input (checkbox, input, select, textarea) components
- [x] Nav component
- [x] DateRangePicker component
- [x] Paginator component
- [x] Table component
- [x] Layout component
- [x] Spinner component
- [x] Flash component
- [x] DetailList component
- [x] Components for basic text + layout (paragraphs, headers, subcontent, etc...)
- [x] Actions container component
- [ ] Initial UI kit website with deploy pipeline
- [ ] Table component scaffolded from trails defined struct
- [ ] Modal forms + regular defined on server component
- [ ] Get icon for project and make it home link
- [ ] Add emitted events to component detail view
- [ ] Make library types links in component detail view
- [ ] Add table component example that uses ActionsDropdown and handles emitted event

## What needs to be fixed?
- [ ] Ensure flatpickr is picked up on build
- [ ] Select install for globally available components
- [ ] Make sure components have names in devtools
- [ ] Look into forcing tables to dropdown when actions open up in hidden area
- [ ] Fix select placeholder only showing up in dropdown
- [ ] DateFilter input heights is not consistent. Make select match datepicker.
